            I'd like to convey my appreciation to the Department of M.Tech
            Integrated Computer Science and Engineering for starting "PULSEE"
            (Program for Understanding, Leadership, Service, Education and
            Excellence) , their first departmental magazine, on their own
            initiative. The fourth industrialization is causing enormous
            technological change in almost every aspect of engineering, but it
            is vital to provide all aspiring engineers with access to
            cutting-edge technology, research, and start-up opportunities.
            Together let's create the next generation of engineers - who
            aren't just engineering graduates but engineers who are drivers of
            change. I heard that the journal's objective is to effectively
            communicate the various chances, tools, and vital discoveries that
            may be helpful in the discipline of computer science and
            engineering. The future demands smarter, more sustainable,
            resilient and innovative solutions, and a new generation of talent
            to deliver them. I wish them all the success for this initiative
            of theirs to bring the various skills of students to the limelight

            I am greatly delighted to see that the Department of M.Tech
            Computer Science and Engineering has come up with a magazine
            titled "PULSEE" (Program for Understanding, Leadership, Service,
            Education and Excellence). Education is the embodiment of love and
            my most treasured possession. It drives away oblivion and through
            illumination, emboldens a man to righteous thought and action.
            Furthermore, it energizes society and enables a man to earn his
            living with respect and praise. The three principles ' Knowledge,
            Skill, and Attitude ' strengthen the quality benevolence of the
            students. I wish that these scholars could achieve tremendously in
            the mere future. I am confident that this publication will serve
            as a source of inspiration for the teachers as well as the
            students to contribute articles regularly to the magazine in
            future. I whole-heartedly congratulate the convener and the
            committee members for successfully publishing the first edition
            with a wealth of content to spark learners' interest and encourage
            them to seek subsequent editions

            Education is a potent tool that helps a person handle life's
            challenges and get past social stigmas. It enables someone to
            travel the world using their knowledge. It is the main factor that
            gives someone the ability to overcome obstacles. It gives immense
            pleasure and delightment that The Department of M.Tech Computer
            Science Engineering has made sincere efforts to provide a
            designated space where faculty and students can contribute their
            inventions and triumphs in the form of a magazine. The "PULSEE"
            (Program for Understanding, Leadership, Service, Education and
            Excellence) programme was developed to encourage young people to
            improve themselves and achieve more. I hope reading this would
            inspire you to work harder and achieve more. I'd like to sincerely
            applaud the team for successfully releasing the first edition of

            (Program for Understanding, Learning, Service, Education and

            my heart is filled with a tremendous amount of joy. The department
            is developing into a sturdy sapling as a result of seeds that were
            sown recent years ago that have already borne fruit. Making
            academics a pleasant trip filled with delight and discovery is our
            goal and that of the entire management. This magazine acts as a
            platform for the students to express their creative pursuits which
            develop originality of thought and perception in them. The
            magazine's articles showcase the students' fantastic creativity

            I am gratified to know that the department of M.Tech Computer
            Science and Engineering is bringing out the first edition of their
            technical magazine â PULSEE â ( Program for Understanding,
            Learning, Service, Education and Excellence ) for this academic
            year (2021-2022). This is a productive technical material and
            subsidiary skill-developing tool for the students. This is an
            effective technical resource and tool for pupils to improve
            ancillary skills. To provide a forum for the researcher and
            student communities to exchange ideas and raise awareness of the
            significance of various subjects linked to their field of study,
            the magazine was launched. It brings the students and teachers of
            various disciplines on a common platform to share and display
            their ideas and creative talents. With their efforts, the
            Department of M.Tech Computer Science and Engineering students
            have formed a joint venture to publish a technical journal. I hope
            that this " PULSEE " establishes itself as a flint to ignite the
            zeal and stir the brains of many intrusive innovations among the
            students and generate fervor among the academic members.
          </p>
          <p>
            Through this message, I wish them
            <span class="italic">"All the very Best"</span> for their future
            endeavors and hope the students of M.Tech CSE bring more laurels
            to the college on the whole.

          In collaboration with Virtusa, The Department of M.Tech CSE hosted a

          students were divided into five teams of twelve students each. In
          the form of a presentation, the teams are required to examine the
          problem statements and provide use cases and technologies that will
          be employed for the project. Before the deadline, students were
          required to produce a functioning web application. The first review
          meeting was held two days after the problem statements were provided
          by the Virtusa team, which included Mr.Rajkumar Sivasubramanian
          (Associate Director, Capability & Transformation Team) and Ms.Mohana
          Priya (Associate Director, Capability & Transformation Team). They
          conducted the meeting and went over the use-case diagrams for the
          website that the students would build during the codeathon. They
          provided us various technology stack alternatives for constructing
          the website. Students expressed their concerns, and they offered a
          clear, comprehensible response. Students were encouraged to
          continually learn and engage with one another in order to foster
          collaboration and work partnerships. After all, the session was
          really enlightening, and students were eager to get started on the

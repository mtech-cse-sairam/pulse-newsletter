              I'd like to convey my appreciation to the Department of M.Tech
              Integrated Computer Science and Engineering for starting "PULSEE"
              (Program for Understanding, Leadership, Service, Education and
              Excellence) , their first departmental magazine, on their own
              initiative. The fourth industrialization is causing enormous
              technological change in almost every aspect of engineering, but it
              is vital to provide all aspiring engineers with access to
              cutting-edge technology, research, and start-up opportunities.
              Together let's create the next generation of engineers - who
              aren't just engineering graduates but engineers who are drivers of
              change. I heard that the journal's objective is to effectively
              communicate the various chances, tools, and vital discoveries that
              may be helpful in the discipline of computer science and
              engineering. The future demands smarter, more sustainable,
              resilient and innovative solutions, and a new generation of talent
              to deliver them. I wish them all the success for this initiative
              of theirs to bring the various skills of students to the limelight

              I am greatly delighted to see that the Department of M.Tech
              Computer Science and Engineering has come up with a magazine
              titled "PULSEE" (Program for Understanding, Leadership, Service,
              Education and Excellence). Education is the embodiment of love and
              my most treasured possession. It drives away oblivion and through
              illumination, emboldens a man to righteous thought and action.
              Furthermore, it energizes society and enables a man to earn his
              living with respect and praise. The three principles ' Knowledge,
              Skill, and Attitude ' strengthen the quality benevolence of the
              students. I wish that these scholars could achieve tremendously in
              the mere future. I am confident that this publication will serve
              as a source of inspiration for the teachers as well as the
              students to contribute articles regularly to the magazine in
              future. I whole-heartedly congratulate the convener and the
              committee members for successfully publishing the first edition
              with a wealth of content to spark learners' interest and encourage
              them to seek subsequent editions

              It is a matter of dignity to pen down the message for " PULSEE "
              (Program for Understanding, Learning, Service, Education and
              Excellence) the magazine of the department of M.Tech Computer
              Science and Engineering. As I see the advancements being achieved,
              my heart is filled with a tremendous amount of joy. The department
              is developing into a sturdy sapling as a result of seeds that were
              sown recent years ago that have already borne fruit. Making
              academics a pleasant trip filled with delight and discovery is our
              goal and that of the entire management. This magazine acts as a
              platform for the students to express their creative pursuits which
              develop originality of thought and perception in them. The
              magazine's articles showcase the students' fantastic creativity
              and imaginative flair. I send my best wishes to the entire faculty
              and my beloved students, encouraging them to continue on this trip
              toward the summit of success.

              I am gratified to know that the department of M.Tech Computer
              Science and Engineering is bringing out the first edition of their
              technical magazine “ PULSEE ” ( Program for Understanding,
              Learning, Service, Education and Excellence ) for this academic
              year (2021-2022). This is a productive technical material and
              subsidiary skill-developing tool for the students. This is an
              effective technical resource and tool for pupils to improve
              ancillary skills. To provide a forum for the researcher and
              student communities to exchange ideas and raise awareness of the
              significance of various subjects linked to their field of study,
              the magazine was launched. It brings the students and teachers of
              various disciplines on a common platform to share and display
              their ideas and creative talents. With their efforts, the
              Department of M.Tech Computer Science and Engineering students
              have formed a joint venture to publish a technical journal. I hope
              that this " PULSEE " establishes itself as a flint to ignite the
              zeal and stir the brains of many intrusive innovations among the
              students and generate fervor among the academic members.
            </p>
            <p>
              Through this message, I wish them
              <span class="italic">"All the very Best"</span> for their future
              endeavors and hope the students of M.Tech CSE bring more laurels
              to the college on the whole.
